I was chillin at the park the other day and that mug got hot dab and ya boy aint like the heat, ya feel? So I move my booty to the Starbucks, trying to get me a cup of joe. The I spot a fine lil honey from across the way. Hopeing I can get something to go my way, I go to her and spit game. I cake it with her, say good stuff about her hair. She give me her digits and now I'm about to chill with her.
